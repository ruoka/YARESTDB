# YarDB - Yet Another RESTFul Database

Under Construction!

This is a DB that has a Web Services API based the RESTFul principles

Data is transported as JSON objects over HTTP/1.1 and stored as FSON objects (i.e. FAST encoded) with some metadata

The DB is implemented with C++17 using libc++ 4.0.0 and Apple's Clang 8.1 CommandLineTools
