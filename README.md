# YarDB - Yet Another RESTFul Database

Under Construction!

The intention of the project is to implement an easy to use document-oriented database that
a. provides a Web API based on the REST principles
b. transports data as JSON-encoded objects over HTTP/1.1 protocol and
c. stored data as FSON-encoded objects (i.e. as FAST-encoded binary data with minimum amount of additional metadata).

The project is implemented with C++17 using the latest version of Clang compiler found from the svn trunk. Please https://clang.llvm.org/get_started.html for information on how to get started with building and running Clang.
